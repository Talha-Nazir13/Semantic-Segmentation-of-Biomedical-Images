<h1>Semantic Segmentation of Biomedical Images</h1>

<p>This project demonstrates how to perform semantic segmentation on biomedical images using deep learning models in PyTorch. Semantic segmentation is essential for precise medical image analysis, including identifying and segmenting various structures in images such as cells, tissues, or lesions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Custom dataset class for loading biomedical image data.</li>
  <li>Data augmentation and preprocessing using PyTorchâ€™s <code>transforms</code>.</li>
  <li>U-Net architecture (or any other model) for performing semantic segmentation.</li>
  <li>Training and validation setup with dataset handling.</li>
  <li>Visualization of predictions and ground truth masks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The project uses the <strong>Warwick</strong> dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset includes medical images with corresponding masks, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks like semantic segmentation.</p>

<h3>Dataset Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>Train/images</code>: Contains training images.</li>
  <li><code>Train/masks</code>: Contains corresponding masks for the training images.</li>
  <li><code>Test/images</code>: Contains testing images.</li>
  <li><code>Test/masks</code>: Contains corresponding masks for the testing images (if applicable).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this project, the following Python packages are required:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>numpy</code></li>
  <li><code>torch</code></li>
  <li><code>torchvision</code></li>
  <li><code>matplotlib</code></li>
  <li><code>Pillow</code> (for image handling)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the dependencies using:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>This project implements the <strong>U-Net</strong> architecture (or mention any other model you've used) for semantic segmentation. U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>To train the model, ensure the dataset is properly placed in the designated folders. You can start training by running the appropriate commands in the Jupyter notebook or as a standalone script.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The trained model can be evaluated on the test set, and the segmentation results will be displayed, showcasing the predicted segmentation masks against the ground truth masks.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You can easily modify the following aspects of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset path</strong>: Adjust the root directory of your dataset in the dataset class.</li>
  <li><strong>Model architecture</strong>: Swap out U-Net for any other segmentation architecture you want to experiment with.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperparameters</strong>: Change the learning rate, batch size, and optimizer in the training loop.</li>
</ul>
